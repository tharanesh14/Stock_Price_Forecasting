# Stock Price Forecasting Project

## Introduction

This project is aimed at forecasting stock prices using machine learning techniques.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install all the necessary Python packages required for the project.

2. Run the Django server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py runserver
    ```

    This will start the Django development server.

## Usage

- Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints to perform various actions related to stock price forecasting.
- Update the documentation with details on how to interact with the API, including endpoint URLs, request formats, and expected responses.
